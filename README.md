CODSOFT Internship - Java Programming Tasks

This repository contains the tasks completed during my CODSOFT Java Programming internship.

Number Game: This is a simple game written in Java where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides hints to help the user find the correct number, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

Student Grade Calculator: This program calculates student grades based on their scores. The user inputs individual scores, and the program calculates the total percentage and determines the corresponding grade according to predefined thresholds.

Currency Converter: A Java program that allows users to convert amounts between USD, INR, EUR and JPY. Users can input an amount and select the desired currency conversion, and the program provides the converted value based on current or predefined exchange rates.
